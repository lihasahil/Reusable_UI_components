# ðŸ§© Reusable React UI Components

This repository contains reusable, accessible, and type-safe UI components built with:

- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)
- [`class-variance-authority (cva)`](https://cva.style/)
- `forwardRef` for composability and integration

Each component is fully typed and leverages `cva` for variant-based styling.

---

## Features

-  Ref forwarding via `React.forwardRef`
-  Class merging using `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`
-  Variant-based styling with `cva`
-  Built with accessibility in mind
-  Fully typed with TypeScript
